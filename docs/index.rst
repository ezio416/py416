What this Python package is and hopes to achieve
------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of various functions, mostly for my own personal use in writing scripts for work and other projects. I built this for the following reasons:

- Learn Python
- Greatly cut down on the amount copy-pasting of code between projects
- Convenience of installing through pip
- Feel good about producing something that looks professional and others can use

The bulk of this package deals with filesystem manipulation as that's what I need it for most.
