- joinpath()
    - does not work for lone single+double dots
        -> '.' or '..'
        - resolves to current working directory due to splitpath()
        - they do work if at the end of a path string and not alone
            -> 'C:/Users/..' or '/mnt/.'
- splitpath()
    - does not work for single+double dots anywhere but a single instance at the end
        -> 'C:/Users/../Windows' or '../usr/things' or '/Users/a/b/../..'
